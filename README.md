# Grade-Point-Average-Calculator-App
g a program that will collect any number of grades from a user. Your program will sort these grades numerically from highest to lowest and calculate the grade point average of the user. Your program will then ask for the average the user desires and calculate what the user must get on their next assignment to achieve this average. Lastly, your program will make a copy of the users grades and allow them to alter one of their previous grades to see how doing worse or better on an assignment would have changed their overall average
